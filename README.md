# 🎯 Monte Carlo Estimation of π (Interactive App)

This project is an interactive web application built with Streamlit that demonstrates how to estimate π using a Monte Carlo simulation. Users can experiment with different sample sizes and visually observe how the approximation improves as the number of random points increases.

## 📌 Overview

The Monte Carlo method estimates π by randomly generating points inside a unit square and measuring how many fall inside a quarter circle.

Since:

* Area of quarter circle = π/4
* Area of square = 1

We can estimate:

π ≈ 4 × (points inside circle / total points)

This app allows users to explore this concept interactively.

## 🧠 Features

* Select number of simulation points:

  * 10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000
* Real-time estimation of π
* Error calculation vs true value of π
* Visual scatter plot:

  * Points inside the circle
  * Points outside the circle
* Clean and interactive UI powered by Streamlit

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Generate `n` random points uniformly in the unit square

2. Compute distance from origin for each point

3. Count how many points lie inside the quarter circle

4. Estimate π using:

   π ≈ 4 × (inside / total)

5. Visualize results
